                Ever since I recall myself, I've always been passionate about the geek world. Games, comics, books, anime, movies and much more. Being able to experience those stories in the confort of my room was priceless.
                <br>I think I've been playing games since I was 3, might have played almost a thousand. Since I started working I haven't had that much time, but I still try to play as much as I can.
